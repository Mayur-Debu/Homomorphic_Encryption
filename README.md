### Briefing of the project:

#### 1. 'client.py' sits with the customer/client and include functions to generate and store the private and public key pair, it also consist of function to help decrypt the data files once received from the server.<br>
#### 2. 'server.py' and 'MachineLearningModel.py' sits on the server side where the scaler complex calculations can be done that includes Machine Learning algorithm. <br>
#### 3. These files would receive a 'json' object with encrypted data and use the weights from the model in 'MachineLearningModel.py' and do the explicit calculations in the 'server.py' file.<br> 
#### 4. This file also includes method to package up the answer and return it back to the client; where, the file can be further decrypted.
